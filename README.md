\[PL\] Aplikacja wspomagajÄ…ca keszowanie na platformie [opencaching.pl].
\[EN\] [opencaching.pl]'s mobile application.

### Version, status
**Version**: 0.0.3
**Status**: Early stage of development, _proof of concept_

### Build and installation
 - Get the source from repository
 - Get the most recent version of [ionicons.com], and extract the `fonts` folder to `www/lib/ionicframework/fonts/`
 - Import the project into **IntelXDK** (free registration needed) 
 - Build an application using **IntelXDK**

### Development
Want to contribute? Technologies used:
 - IntelXDK as IDE
 - Ionic.js with Cordova
 - Angularjs (as part of ionic stack)
 
As for now, the project is in the "proof-of-concept" stage.
Therefore, the best IMO way to contribute is to send ideas of features.
I'd be also happy to accept any valuable merge requests (I am not a _angularjs_ or _ionic_ hacker_ yet).

### What works?
 - online leafletjs map
